## Introduction

DeLightFi is an innovative organization that is revolutionizing the DeFi landscape by building solutions on Layer 2. With a focus on lightning-fast transactions, lower fees, and unparalleled user experiences, DeLightFi has developed two cutting-edge products: Morphine and Starken.

- **Morphine**: DeFi layer allowing composable leverage and on-chain automation. By offering undercollateralized loans and dynamically adjusting interest rates through an on-chain rate engine, Morphine provides a high level of liquidity and less dilluted rewards for lenders, making it a valuable option to earn a passive income. Morphine's active management feature provides users with a unique experience that resembles that of centralized exchanges (CEXs) but within the DeFi space. With composable leverage to various DeFi products, users can deploy a sub-account and set automation conditions based on token prices and allocations. This allows for greater control and customization over one's DeFi portfolio and eliminates the need for manual intervention.

- **Starken**:Indexing infrastructure providing insights into portfolio evolution, yield APY analysis, and more. It comes with an SDK that can help users build their own DeFi apps further. Starken offers features such as token holdings and USD value over time, integration with LP and yield-bearing tokens, asset selection or removal, on-chain PNL, and multi-account aggregation, making it a powerful tool for tracking and optimizing DeFi investments.

The synergy between Morphine and Starken is that users can check strategies APY on Starken and then transit to Morphine to set up their position with leverage, take profit, and stop loss automation. This enables users to make more informed decisions about their investments and take advantage of the unique features of Morphine to optimize their returns. Overall, DeLightFi's products provide users with an unparalleled DeFi experience, combining advanced automation, portfolio insights, and cutting-edge solutions in the DeFi space.
